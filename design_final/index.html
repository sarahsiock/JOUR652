<p>Carolyn Robbins puts her students first when teaching communication courses at the University of Maryland. </p>
  
<p>Robbins designs the syllabus for her courses, creates all class assignments and was even awarded the department’s Outstanding Teaching Award. Yet, Robbins is not a full-time faculty member, she is a third-year Ph.D. candidate studying communications and teaching courses as a graduate assistant.</p>

<p>Robbins loves her work and her students but she is often left feeling frustrated with her working conditions and compensation. In addition to teaching at least six credit hours every semester, she is a graduate administrative assistant for the communications department being paid just $26,000 annually for both jobs.</p>
 
<p>“If you feed the beast of academia, it'll take as many hours as we'll give it. I got to the point where I was reminding myself, ‘They're not even really paying you for the time you are on the clock.’ But it's hard because a lot of us got to this point of being in grad school because we're go-getters, we're high achievers and we want to get it done,” said Robbins, adding that graduate students teach over 50% of courses in the communications department.</p>

<p>Robbins' grievances led her to become a member of Fearless Student Employees, a group of UMD graduate assistants who advocate for labor and collective bargaining rights. </p>


<p> Without collective bargaining rights, graduate assistants cannot legally create binding contracts with their employers. Fearless Student Employees is working to achieve better working conditions and livable wages for graduate assistants in the University System of Maryland through the passing of House Bill 275 and Senate Bill 247. The bill would allow graduate assistants and faculty in public higher education institutions across the state the right to collectively bargain.</p>

<p>“Our mission is to organize grads on campus, hear their stories, hear their concern and kind of galvanize folks towards a collective mass movement. It will be a grand show of force to compel the university to give us those bargaining rights,” said Jan-Michael Archer, president of Fearless Student Employees and fifth-year Ph.D. student, in the School of Public Health.</p>

<h2 class= headerbar> Graduate Assistants Travel to Annapolis </h2>



<p>The minimum salary for graduate assistants at UMD is <a href="http://gradschool.umd.edu/sites/gradschool.umd.edu/files/uploads/docs/revised_fy23_stipend_memo.pdf" target="_blank">$24,000,</a> a stark difference from $41,516, the average salary of a Maryland resident, according to the United States Census. </p>



    <p>Archer said the current compensation for graduate assistants presents many obstacles for students including finding affordable housing. </p>
    <p>“One of the biggest issues is housing for grad students is not just having to pay for housing, but finding safe housing. It's not necessarily safe to room up with a bunch of different strangers,” said Archer.</p>

 <div class= "large-6 medium-6 small-12 cell">

 <p>Fearless Student Employee’s mission goes beyond worker’s compensation and focuses on providing graduate assistants a voice in the workplace. </p>


<div class="row column medium-9 large-7">
 <q class="pull-quote">A union would let us hold their feet to the fire. It gives us leverage to say, 'here's a list of demands that you will meet by this date, or we will stop working and you will continue to pay us because we are legally protected on strike,'" said Robbins.</q> 
</div>




<p>Since January, members of Fearless Student Employees have regularly traveled to Annapolis, Maryland, to speak with house delegates and create support for legislation that aligns with Fearless Student Employee’s goals. The organization also created a <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/support-the-right-to-living-wages-and-collective-bargaining-for-maryland-higher-ed-workers" target="_blank">petition,</a> calling on the University of Maryland System Chancellor Jay Perman and other campus leaders to support living wages and collective bargaining rights for all higher education workers. The petition currently has over 2,330 signatures. </p>

<p>Currently, House Bill 275 has not been called to a vote in the legislature. Yet, Fearless Student Employees remain optimistic in their work.</p>

<p>“We need to build community and build power within our movement so we can get to the point where more than half of the graduate worker population are saying ‘I want a union,’” said Archer. </p>
