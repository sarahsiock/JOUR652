Barack Obama was the 44th president of the United States. He served two four-year terms from 2009-2019 and was the country’s first African American president. Obama was elected in the depth of a recession that followed the 2008 financial crisis. The Obama administration’s general agenda included providing accessible and affordable health care to all, tackling climate change and reviving the economy. According to the Historical Gallup Poll, Obama’s highest approval rating was 68% in January 2009. While Obama is no longer in office, he remains politically active and campaigned for Joe Biden, his former vice president, during the 2020 election cycle.
